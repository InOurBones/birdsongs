    "For this notebook I've limited to the specifies which start with an 'a' and 'b' to reduce the load and training time.\n",
    "Eventually the dataset could be extended to use the other datasets as well, but that won't be done in this notebook.\n",
    "the dataset used for this can be found on: [https://www.kaggle.com/ttahara/birdsong-resampled-train-audio-00](https://www.kaggle.com/ttahara/birdsong-resampled-train-audio-00)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common knowledge that raw audio files cannot be used as input for a ML model. They have to be transformed first into something the computer understands. Therefore, an audio can be transformed into a spectogram. This visualizes the strength of a soundwave over the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple libraries to convert audio files to spectograms such as scipy, torch, pylab and librosa to name a few. At my job as data engineer/analysist I've already created ML audio to identify music genres of audio tracks. For that we used scipy. To spice things up I've choosen to use PyTorch to experience something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "the different steps for this notebook are described below:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>sound files</li>\n",
